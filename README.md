##Project Background
In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. 
However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. 
To address this, we have developed ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based 
functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery.

##Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), 
build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements.

##Integrate Function Calling API: 
Modify the existing architecture to leverage the Function Calling API's capabilities for improved performance. Scope out which layers can be removed and how the existing layers can be updated to handle the new approach.
##Refine Conversation Flow: 
Enhance the chatbot's conversation flow by leveraging function calling. Make the interaction between the user and the chatbot more natural and dynamic.
##Document and Present: 
Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the changes made, the integration process, and the benefits of using the Function Calling API. Prepare a presentation to showcase the enhancements.
